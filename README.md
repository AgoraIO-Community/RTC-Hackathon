# Challenge Introduction

RTC (Real Time Communication) Hackathon is an online hackathon held by Agora for RTC developers, programming enthusiasts and geeks worldwide.

SoundNet has accumulated 7 years of technology in the RTC field. The Agora SDK launched is widely integrated in applications in various fields such as video conferencing, social entertainment, online education, online healthcare, Internet of Things, and finance.

And we believe that RTC technology can do much more than that, and its boundary is extended by you and me.

This online hackathon will be conducted in the form of "online programming + online submission + online final", aiming to encourage more RTC technology enthusiasts to join in, while experiencing and familiarizing with the sound network products, further understand and apply RTC Technology, jointly promote the innovation, prosperity and development of the RTC ecosystem.

(In July we will also hold the RTC hackathon autumn race, please wait and see.)

# Challenge Introduction & Works Requirements
## Track 1: Designing UI for "Multi-person Call"
Recently, many people have fully experienced online office and video conferencing. Did you find out how to operate it? Can't find many functions? The interface layout is not pleasing? This time gives you a chance to create, based on a video call Demo we provide, to design the best UI and code for multi-person video calls.

## Work requirements:
* Must choose the official designated Demo, and do customized UI development on this basis ([Download Link](https://rtcdeveloper.com/t/topic/17072))
* UI design creative content is not limited, you can refer to any related works that you think UX experience is good
* The ownership of the UI design prototype submitted by the default participant belongs to the participant, and there is no legal dispute
* The works submitted by the final participants will be open sourced under the MIT agreement


## Track 2: Using Agora SDK to develop applications
Because of this epidemic, in addition to online teaching and video conferences, popular scenes also spawned Yun Biaodi and Yun Gathering. In this competition, you can use the Agora SDK to give more scenes real-time audio and video interaction capabilities. You can also use these innovations to win awards and hurry up ~

## Work requirements
* Entries must integrate one of the SDKs of Agora Agora, which can be audio / video call / live broadcast SDK, real-time messaging SDK, recording SDK, interactive game SDK, real-time stream acceleration SDK
* Participants develop new applications or enter based on original project modifications. The review will eventually review the source code to ensure fairness.
* The application can be to realize an application scenario, such as video conferencing, online classroom, live streaming, audio and video chat, social games, home security, etc., or to solve a real problem.
* For other related ideas, please refer to previous hackathon works ([Link](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/AI-in-RTC_ProgrammingChallenge))
* There is no legal dispute in the works submitted by default participants
* The source code of the works submitted by the contestants are all open source under the MIT open source agreement
